# AA-30.Zero

This was a project that was started on a Coffee and Ham Radios Youtube Live Stream.

[Coffee and Ham Radios Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/CoffeeandHamRadios)

From there [Temporarily Offline](https://www.youtube.com/c/temporarilyoffline), [Ham Radio Dude](https://www.youtube.com/c/HAMRADIODUDE),  [TheSmokinApe](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheSmokinApe), and [Chuck](https://www.youtube.com/c/KK6USYHamRadioAdventures) each took a different part of the project and demonstrated it on live streams.  

NOTE: You will need to flash the firmware on the RigExpert for this to work
(Shown in Dude's video), Linked below.

Here is the repository for a few different versions of the code:

* The original Ham Radio Dude version: CAHRFINAL-Analyzer.ino
* The TO playground version that includes some speed improvements: TO-Analyzer.ino
* The TO Wizard version (TODO) that will walk you through tuning your antenna for a selected band
* The Ultimate Version that uses the rest of the functions (TODO):
    * getR
    * getRp
    * getX
    * getXp
    * getRL
    * getPhase
    * getRho

Feel free to use and contribute to this repo.
